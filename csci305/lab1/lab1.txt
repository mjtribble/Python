1. I like being able to access items in a list directly with a for loop without having to keep track with an index. It increases both readability and writability as compared to C or Java

2. I dislike not being able to use the -- and ++ operations, although it is a pretty minor thing. Everything else is pretty easy once you get the hang of it. 

3. I enjoyed learning how to set up python, learing about regular expressions, and using the dictionary structures of python. I wish there were clearer output specifications or an example of what you'd like the output to look like. I hope what I did is sufficient. 

4. A lot, I'd rather not say =) If you want honest answers maybe use an anonymous poll?

5. I will definataly use python again, whenever it is required for an assignment or a job, it seems great for data processing (easy loops, sweet dictionary structure etc)
